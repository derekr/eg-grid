Clean up stale code after removing plugin registry, provider registry, and simplifying state machine.

## Children
- Repurpose worker for Datastar example
- Remove outdated bundles (keep just one)
- Update docs (README, accessibility guide)
- Remove plugin toggling from architecture example

## Reasons for Scrapping

Obsolete after condensed-first restructuring. The old multi-file plugin architecture was replaced with a single-file library. See bean egg-ivjb.
