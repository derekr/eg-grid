Future improvements for the dev overlay (Shift+D):

- [ ] Grid lines visual overlay
- [ ] Persist settings to localStorage
- [ ] Explore popover/dialog for top-layer rendering (attempted, needs more work)

## Reasons for Scrapping

Obsolete after condensed-first restructuring. The old multi-file plugin architecture was replaced with a single-file library. See bean egg-ivjb.
