Responsive layout core is complete (layout-model.ts, responsive.ts, container queries) but lacks documentation and examples.

- [ ] Document responsive usage in README
- [ ] Add example-responsive.html demo
- [ ] Test with actual browser resizing

## Reasons for Scrapping

Obsolete after condensed-first restructuring. The old multi-file plugin architecture was replaced with a single-file library. See bean egg-ivjb.
