Document how to use gridiot within a Datastar project.

Datastar uses a hypermedia-driven approach with server-sent events. Explore:
- How gridiot events can trigger Datastar actions (SSE signals, backend calls)
- Using gridiot as a Datastar plugin or alongside Datastar
- The backend algorithm delegation pattern (see bean gridiot-zw0e)
- Example showing drag-to-reorder that persists via Datastar/HTMX backend

The Cloudflare server used for the bundle builder can also host server-driven Datastar examples (SSE endpoints, backend persistence, etc.).
