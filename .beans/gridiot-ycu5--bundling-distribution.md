Epic covering all work related to building, bundling, and distributing gridiot — custom bundle builder UI, pre-built bundles, CDN serving via jsDelivr, release workflow, and framework integrations (Web Component, React, Datastar).

## Reasons for Scrapping

Obsolete after condensed-first restructuring. The old multi-file plugin architecture was replaced with a single-file library. See bean egg-ivjb.
