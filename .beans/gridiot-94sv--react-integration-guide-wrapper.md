Document and/or build a thin React wrapper or guide for using gridiot in React projects.

Options to explore:
- Direct usage with useEffect + refs (guide/example)
- Thin React wrapper component that manages lifecycle
- How to handle React's virtual DOM vs gridiot's direct DOM manipulation
- SSR considerations

Could be a guide, a small wrapper package, or both.
